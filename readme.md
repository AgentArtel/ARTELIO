# ARTELIO - AI-Powered RPG Experience

ARTELIO is an interactive RPG game built with [RPGJS](https://rpgjs.dev) that features AI-powered NPCs, dynamic dialogue, and generative art/photography experiences.

## Features

### AI-Powered NPCs
- **Artist NPC**: Generates unique artwork based on player interactions using AI image generation
- **Photographer NPC**: Takes portrait photos of the player with dynamic poses and lighting
- **Quest Giver NPC**: Provides dynamic quests with AI-generated content and themes
- **Emotion Bubbles**: NPCs display emotions during interactions (happiness, sadness, thinking, etc.)
- **Dynamic Dialogue**: NPCs respond contextually to player choices and previous interactions

### Technical Implementation
- **External API Integration**: Uses webhooks for AI image generation, dialogue, and quest generation
- **Environment Variables**: Securely manages API endpoints and configuration
- **Inventory System**: Custom items that store and display generated artwork
- **GUI Components**: Custom image viewer for displaying generated art and photographs
- **Quest System**: Dynamic quest generation with collectible quest items

## Getting Started

## Quest System

ARTELIO features a dynamic quest system where quests are represented as physical items in the player's inventory:

### Quest Scrolls
Quest scrolls are items that contain quest details generated by the Quest Giver NPC:

```typescript
@Item({
    id: 'quest-scroll',
    name: 'Quest Scroll',
    description: 'A scroll containing details of a quest from the Quest Master.',
    consumable: false,
    type: 'quest'
})
export default class QuestScroll {
    static title: string = 'Quest Scroll'
    static description: string = 'A quest from the Quest Master'
    static theme: string = 'village landscape'
    
    // Method to set quest details
    static setQuestDetails(title: string, description: string, theme: string) {
        this.title = title
        this.description = description
        this.theme = theme
    }
}
```

### Art Commissions
Players can take quest scrolls to the Artist NPC who will create a custom painting based on the quest theme:

```typescript
// Generate artwork based on the theme using the webhook
const response = await axios.post(config.webhooks.artGeneration, {
    prompt: QuestScroll.theme,
    playerName: player.name || 'Adventurer'
})

// Extract the image URL and create a painting
VillagePainting.setCustomPainting(
    imageUrl,
    QuestScroll.title,
    `A beautiful painting based on the theme: ${QuestScroll.theme}. Created by Aria, the village artist.`
)
```

## Implementation Details

### NPC Structure

Each AI-powered NPC follows this implementation pattern:

```typescript
@EventData({
    name: 'npc-identifier',
    mode: EventMode.Shared,
    hitbox: {
        width: 32,
        height: 16
    }
})
export default class NPCEvent extends RpgEvent {
    onInit() {
        // Set appearance and components
        this.setGraphic('sprite-name')
        this.setComponentsTop(Components.text('NPC Name'))
    }
    
    async onAction(player: RpgPlayer) {
        // Handle player interaction
        // Show emotions, dialogue, etc.
    }
    
    // Custom methods for specific NPC functionality
}
```

### Emotion Bubbles

We use the `@rpgjs/plugin-emotion-bubbles` plugin to display NPC emotions:

```typescript
// Show an emotion bubble
this.showEmotionBubble(EmotionBubble.Happy)

// Available emotions:
// - Happy
// - Sad
// - Exclamation
// - Question
// - Heart
// - Angry
// - Sweat
// - Music
// - Sleep
// - ThreeDot
// - Clock
```

### Webhook Integration

AI-powered features use webhook calls to external services:

```typescript
const response = await axios.post(config.webhooks.artGeneration, {
    prompt: 'Your prompt here'
})

// Extract the image URL from the response
const imageUrl = response.data.url
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Context Management**: When using `setInterval` in RPG-JS events, store a reference to `this` using `const self = this` to maintain the correct context.

2. **Quest Item Implementation**: When implementing quest items, use static properties to store quest details that can be accessed and modified by different NPCs.

2. **Player Variables**: Use player variables to persist state between interactions:
   ```typescript
   // Set a variable
   player.setVariable('VARIABLE_NAME', value)
   
   // Get a variable
   const value = player.getVariable('VARIABLE_NAME')
   ```

3. **Asynchronous Operations**: Always use `async/await` for operations like showing text, making API calls, or opening GUI components.

4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling for external API calls to provide fallback options if the call fails.
